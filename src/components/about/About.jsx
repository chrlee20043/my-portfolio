            My passion for web development started in 2019 when I first learned
            HTML to update and maintain my employer's website at a nonprofit. I
            continued to develop my skills a Client Support Specialist at a SaaS
            startup where I worked closely with clients and engineers and
            developed more technical skills, starting with SQL.
            <br />
            <br />
            I recently graduated from the Grace Hopper coding bootcamp at
            Fullstack Academy. I really enjoyed the collaborative learning
            environment and working independently and on a team to build apps
            and learn new technologies.
            <br />
